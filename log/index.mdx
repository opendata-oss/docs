description: Key-oriented event streaming built on an LSM tree
---

Log is an append-only event streaming system built on [SlateDB](https://slatedb.io)
and object storage. Records are organized by key and assigned a global sequence
number, making it easy to fan out ordered events to multiple consumers. Because
all data is durably stored in object storage, a single replica provides full
durability with no operational overhead for replication or backups.
