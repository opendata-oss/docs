description: Object-store-native time series database with Prometheus compatibility
---

Timeseries is a Prometheus-compatible metrics database built on
[SlateDB](https://slatedb.io) and object storage. It speaks PromQL, scrapes
Prometheus targets, accepts OpenTelemetry metrics, and works out of the box
with Grafana. Because all data is durably stored in object storage, a single
replica provides full durability with no operational overhead for replication
or backups.
