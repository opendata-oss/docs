title: Deployment

OpenData is fundamentally designed to have a flexible architecture
that scales to meet the use case. Smaller deployments can be deployed
on a single machine while still providing (meaningfuly) high availability
and object-storage backed durability. Larger deployments can scale to multiple
zones and regions, providing high availability and disaster recovery.

## Embedded Option

At their core each database can run as an embedded rust process that
you can access via the rust API (FFI integrations for other languages
are planned, though not currently prioritized). The embedded option
is a fully viable option for production deployments. 

Since durability is managed fully by object storage, a crash/restart
of an application embedding a database will not lose any data that
was acknowledged as durable. While we recommend running OpenData services
with persistent disks for cache durability, this is not required.

In addition, if a pod running the embedded database crashes, new deployments
of it will fence the old writer to ensure consistentcy in the event the
old service comes back online and attempts to write new data.

## Single Binary Server

OpenData systems are fully deployable with single binaries. We provide
binaries for most common operating systems and architectures as well as
docker images. This makes it easy to deploy an OpenData system both on
your laptop as well as in production.

The difference between the embedded and single binary server options is that
the binaries package additional dependencies required to run an HTTP server
to handle requests from a client over the network. 

## Distributed System

<Info>
    We are currently designing more native distributed deployment options
    that will support shuffling data across partitions for a smoother
    scaling experience.
</Info>

For larger deployments, we currently recommend partitioning your data into
cells and deploying a single-writer database in each cell. This allows you to
scale your deployment horizontally by adding more partitions.
